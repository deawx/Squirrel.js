Squirrel.js
===========

Store form values in HTML5 sessionStorage automatically as the user types with this jQuery plugin.

To get started, simply include the plugin after your jQuery library is loaded, and add a class of `squirrel` to your form. The plugin does its own bindings for that class, otherwise you can set it up to target your forms using the code below:

```js
$(".my-form").squirrel();
```
