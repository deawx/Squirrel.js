Squirrel.js
===========

Make forms more manageable by storing form values in HTML5 sessionStorage automatically using this jQuery plugin.

To get started, simply include the plugin after your jQuery library is loaded, and add a class of `squirrel` to your form. The plugin does its own bindings for that class, otherwise you can set it up to target your forms using the code below:

	$(".my-form").squirrel();
